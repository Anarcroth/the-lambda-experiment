# The Lambda Experiment

is a project that has no real meaning actually. Over the course of learning new functional languages, the books, tests, and tasks that are encountered, really help with solidifying new found knowledge. Thus the proper way to view this repo is to take it as a bunch of small solutions to made-up problems (which almost sounds close to work).

The only positive thing you might find here, are implementations to various problems you might have seen in said books/tests/tasks.

Everything will be documented in the source, etc. etc.
